// Simplest possible induction proof.
// noninteger induction variable in induction conclusion

P1: proof
   base: P(0) by trustMe

   ind: proof
        var n \in \integers

	A1: n \ge 0 by assumption
	A2: P(n) by assumption
	C1: P(n+1) by trustMe
   end

  C2:  \forall n \in \reals: (n \ge 0 \implies P(n)) by simpleInduction(base, ind)
