// Useless quantifiers 

P1: proof
C1: \exists x: P
<=> P by quantElim
<=> \forall x: P by quantElim
end


// "distributing" exists over implies

P2: proof
C1: \exists x: (P(x) -> Q(x))
<=> \exists x: (not P(x) or Q(x)) by impliesOr
<=> \exists x: not P(x) or \exists x: Q(x) by distribExistsOr
<=> not \forall x: P(x) or \exists x: Q(x) by deMorganForall
<=> (\forall x: P(x)) -> (\exists x: Q(x)) by impliesOr
end

// moving quantifiers to the front (ie prenex normal form, though they don't need to know that)

P3: proof
C1: \forall x: ((not \forall y: P(y)) or Q(x)) and \forall x: R(x)
<=> \forall x: ((\exists y: not P(y)) or Q(x)) and \forall x: R(x) by deMorganForall
<=> \forall x: (((\exists y: not P(y)) or Q(x)) and R(x)) by distribForallAnd
<=> \forall x: ((\exists y: not P(y) or (\exists y: Q(x))) and R(x)) by quantElim
<=> \forall x: ((\exists y: (not P(y) or Q(x))) and R(x)) by distribExistsOr
<=> \forall x: ((\exists y: (not P(y) or Q(x))) and \exists y: R(x)) by quantElim
<=> \forall x: \exists y: ((not P(y) or Q(x)) and R(x)) by distribExistsAnd
end

// a non-obvious tautology

P4: proof
C1: \exists x: (P(x) -> (\forall y: P(y)))
<=> \exists x: (not P(x) or (\forall y: P(y))) by impliesOr
<=> \exists x: (not P(x)) or \exists x: (\forall y: P(y)) by distribExistsOr
<=> \exists x: (not P(x)) or \forall y: P(y) by quantElim
<=> \exists x: (not P(x)) or \forall x: P(x) by renaming
<=> not \forall x : P(x) or \forall x: P(x) by deMorganForall
<=> T by orInverse
end

// combining implications

P5: proof
C1: \forall x : (P(x) -> Q(x)) and \forall y: (P(y) \implies R(y)) 
<=> \forall x: (P(x) -> Q(x)) and \forall x : (P(x) \implies R(x)) by renaming
<=> \forall x: ((P(x) -> Q(x)) and (P(x) -> R(x))) by distribForallAnd
<=> \forall x: ((not P(x) or Q(x)) and (not P(x) or R(x))) by impliesOr
<=> \forall x: (not P(x) or (Q(x) and R(x))) by distribOrAnd
<=> \forall x: (P(x) -> Q(x) and R(x)) by impliesOr
