// This exercises every rule
// For compactness, this puts several unrelated identity proofs inside one proof.
// You should NOT do this on the homework.
P1: proof

// associativity and commutativity with and/or are "obvious
C1:  (P and Q) and R <=> P and (Q and R) by obvious
C2:  P or Q <=> Q or P by obvious   
C3:  P and Q and R and S and T <=> R and (T and (Q and P) and S) by obvious
C4:  P and Q <=> Q and P by obvious 

// The checker will attempt to apply the same rule twice in some cases.
// If this doesn't work, try breaking it down into smaller steps.
C5: (P -> Q) and (R -> S) <=> (not P or Q) and (not R or S) by impliesOr

// When applying distributive law, it matters which operator is on
// top.  distribAndOr != distribOrAnd.
C6:  P and (Q or R) <=> (P and Q) or (P and R) by distribAndOr
C7:   P or (Q and R) <=> (P or Q) and (P or R) by distribOrAnd
// Notice that "or" is on top when distribAnd or is applied
// "backwards".
C8:  (P and Q) or (P and R) <=>  P and (Q or R) by distribAndOr

C9: not (P and Q) <=>  not P or not Q by deMorganAnd
C10: not (P or Q) <=>  not P and not Q by deMorganOr

// various rules from lecture
C11: P and T <=> P by andIdentity
C12: P or  F <=> P by orIdentity

C13:   P and  P <=> P by andIdempotence
C14:   P or  P <=> P by orIdempotence

C15:   P and not P <=> F by andInverse
C16:   P or not P <=> T by orInverse

C17:   P and F <=> F by andDomination
C18:   P or T <=> T by orDomination

C19:  P -> Q <=> not P or Q by impliesOr
C20:  P <-> Q <=> (P -> Q) and (Q -> P) by bicondImplies
