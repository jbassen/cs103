Testing strategy for transitive proofs.

Exposing hidden state & actions would be helpful
  * Do chains of length 1 get processed?
  * What is summary conclusion for longer chains?
* Allow run-time configuration variables in commands?

Transitive chain of size 1.

Test each transitive operator.

Transitive chain of size > 1.

Incompatible predicates (<, subset)

predicates in different directions. (<, >)

Chain with increasing strictness

Chain with decreasing strictness

Chain at start

Chain at end

Chain in middle

Multiple chains.

Chain where first step does not check

Chain where last step does not check

Chain where middle step does not check.
